Answer 1: It's good to use a remote repository when there a multiple people working on the same file or there exists a situation 
requiring collaboration from multiple people. This is usually the case when major changes need to be made.

Answer 2: It is better to pull changes manually so that you can work on a new branch on your local machine and then push your changes to 
GitHub. Having Git automatically update also takes up internet bandwidth and/or memory power

Answer 3: Forks are repositories cloned between GitHub accounts.
Clones are replications of a repositories between GitHub and one's
local machine or within the local machine.
Branches are a copy of a repository at a particular juncture that 
document changes in a separate commit history from the original branch
name. One would use branches to test new features or create different 
flavors of a program. Forking is used to share repositories between 
different people, who can then clone into their local machines.
